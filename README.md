## Motivation

The C3NOC runs a conference network with thousands of clients for about a week
every year. We like to listen to electronic music while doing so. And we like to
monitor our uplink constantly. And we like to combine things in a silly way. We
have previously successfully combined [switches and alcoholic drinks](https://twitter.com/danrlde/status/681216933883150336) as well as
[cyber squirrels](http://cybersquirrel1.com) and fiber-optic cables. Why not combine web radio and uplink
monitoring?


## Circuit

ip2radio is based on a [C.H.I.P.](http://www.getchip.com) 9$ computer and a
custom-build, very simple shield. On top of that runs very simple python code.
Don't expect great magic!
